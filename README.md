#JAVASYNTH

A JavaScript-based soundboard. Controllable via physical keyboard or on-screen elements. Easy to customize and modify with alternate sound libraries.

#HOW TO USE:

Simply download the zip and open the 'index.html' file in your browser of choice. All sound clips are included.

The soundboard can be triggered using either a physical keyboard or by clicking the on-screen keys. 

To add your own sounds replace the audio files included in the 'sounds' folder with your own wav files (make sure the filenames match.)
